# Carbon Credit Dashboard (MVP v0.1)
This is a responsive React dashboard UI built for EcoReclaim as part of a frontend MVP trial task. The app displays a list of carbon credits available on EcoLedger, with filtering, searching, and detailed views using mock data.

## Features
### Dashboard View with carbon credit cards:

- Displays key info – Project Name, Location, Certification, CO₂ Offset, Price per Ton

### Single Credit View:
- Click to view full details in a new page (with simulated routing)

### Search & Filter:
- Search by project type and filter by type (e.g., Reforestation)

### Responsive Design:
- Built with Tailwind CSS to adapt across mobile, tablet, and desktop


## Tech Stack
- React 19 + Vite 6 – fast development and modern bundling

- React Router v7 – declarative routing for nested views

- Zustand – lightweight and scalable global state management

- Tailwind CSS v4 – for fast, utility-first styling

- TypeScript – type safety

- Icons – from react-icons for simple visuals


## Design Decisions
- Zustand was chosen for state simplicity without boilerplate.

- Tailwind CSS enabled rapid, mobile-first styling.
